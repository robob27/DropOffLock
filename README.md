### DropOffLock mod for Minecraft.
***
Mod, in functionality similar to the DropOff button from the [Quark](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/quark), but with hot key and flexible configuration for any needs.

Based on [DropOff](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/dropoff) mod for Minecraft 1.12.2 with the following change(s):
* C hotkey (by default) for locking items in player inventory so they will not be dropped off into chests.

You can click the button in the inventory or press '**X**' (by default), and the contents of the player inventory will be moved to the nearest chests, furnaces and containers from other modifications (see mod config to change any property).
Also, the contents of these containers and player inventory will be sorted (sorting can be disabled).

**WARNING:** In versions for Minecraft 1.10.2 and higher this mod replaces similar functionality from Quark when you press Quark's own button.
If you do not want it to happen, set "Override Quark button" to "false" in config.
